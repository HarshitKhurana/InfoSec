<h3> Buffer Overflow </h3>
<b>-> This repo contains things related to Buffer Overflow only (mostly stack based). </b></br> 
-> For examples/references/code etc all the testing is done on ubuntu 32|64-bit machine unless otherwise stated.
</br>
</br>
<b> Ques : But why now ? </b></br>
Ans : Beause basics are important and moreover though there are many protections available in the compiler to stop from buffer overflow attacks such as Stack Canary , ASLR, DEP etc this doesn't necessarily means that they cannot be bypassed.
